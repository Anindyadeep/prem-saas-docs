### Installation and setup

We start by installing llama-index and premai-sdk. You can type the following command to install:

```bash
pip install premai llama-index
```
Before proceeding further, please make sure that you have made an account on Prem and already started a project. If not, then here's how you can start for free:

1. Sign in to [PremAI](https://app.premai.io/accounts/login/), if you are coming for the first time and create your API key [here](https://app.premai.io/api_keys/).

2. Go to [app.premai.io](https://app.premai.io) and this will take you to the project's dashboard.

3. Create a project and this will generate a project-id (written as ID). This ID will help you to interact with your deployed application.

4. Head over to LaunchPad (the one with ðŸš€ icon). And there deploy your model of choice. Your default model will be `gpt-4`. You can also set and fix different generation paramters (like: max-tokens, temperature etc) and also pre-set your system prompt.

Congratulations on creating your first deployed application on Prem ðŸŽ‰ Now we can use llama-index to interact with our application.

```python
from llama_index.llms.premai import PremAI
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage
```

## Setup ChatPrem instance in LlamaIndex

Once we imported our required modules, let's setup our client. For now let's assume that our `project_id` is `8`. But make sure you use your project-id, otherwise it will throw error.

In order to use llama-index with PremAI, you do not need to pass any model name or set any parameters with our chat-client. All of those will use the default model name and paramters of the LaunchPad model.

<Note>
 If you change the model or any other parameter like temperature while setting the client, it will override existing default configurations.   
</Note>

```python
import os
import getpass

if os.environ.get("PREMAI_API_KEY") is None:
    os.environ["PREMAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("PremAI API Key:")

prem_chat = PremAI(project_id=8)
```
## Calling the Model

Now you are all set. We can now start with interacting with our application. Let's start by building simple chat request and responses using llama-index

```python
messages = [
    ChatMessage(role="user", content="What is your name"),
    ChatMessage(
        role="user", content="Write an essay about your school in 500 words"
    ),
]
```
Please note that: You can provide system prompt here too, like this:

```python
messages = [
    ChatMessage(role="system", content="Act like a pirate"),
    ChatMessage(role="user", content="What is your name"),
    ChatMessage(role="user", content="Where do you live, write an essay in 500 words"),
]
```
On the other hand you can also instantiate your object with system prompt like this:

```python
chat = PremAI(project_id=8, system_prompt="Act like nemo fish")
```
In both of the scenarios, you are going to override your system prompt that was fixed while deploying the application from the platform. And, specifically in this case, if you override system prompt while instantiating the **PremAI** class then system message in `ChatMessage` won't provide any affect.

So if you want to override system prompt for any experimental cases, either you need to provide that while instantiating the class or while writing `ChatMessage` with a role `system`.

Now let's call the model


```python
response = prem_chat.chat(messages)
print(response)
```
You can also convert your chat function to a completion function. Here's how it works

```python
completion = prem_chat.complete("Paul Graham is ")
```

## Streaming

In this section, let's see how we can stream tokens using llama-index and PremAI. It is very similar to above methos. Here's how you do it.

```python
streamed_response = prem_chat.stream_chat(messages)

for response_delta in streamed_response:
    print(response_delta.delta, end="")
```

This will stream tokens one after the other. Similar to `complete` method, we have `stream_complete` method which does streaming of tokens for completion.

**Like this:**

```python
# This will stream tokens one by one

streamed_response = prem_chat.stream_complete("hello how are you")

for response_delta in streamed_response:
    print(response_delta.delta, end="")
```

## Embeddings
In this section we are going to dicuss how we can get access to different embedding model using `PremEmbeddings` with llama-index

```python
from llama_index.embeddings.premai import PremAIEmbeddings
```
## Setup PremAIEmbeddings instance in LlamaIndex

Once we imported our required modules, let's setup our client. For now let's assume that our `project_id` is `8`. But make sure you use your project-id, otherwise it will throw error. In case of embeddings you also have to additionally pass `model`. 

Here are the list of available models on PremAI:

| Provider    | Slug                                     | Context Tokens |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| cohere      | embed-english-v3.0                       | N/A            |
| openai      | text-embedding-3-small                   | 8191           |
| openai      | text-embedding-3-large                   | 8191           |
| openai      | text-embedding-ada-002                   | 8191           |
| replicate   | replicate/all-mpnet-base-v2              | N/A            |
| together    | togethercomputer/Llama-2-7B-32K-Instruct | N/A            |
| mistralai   | mistral-embed                            | 4096           |

To change the model, you simply need to copy the `slug` and access your embedding model.

```python
import os
import getpass

if os.environ.get("PREMAI_API_KEY") is None:
    os.environ["PREMAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("PremAI API Key:")

prem_embedding = PremAIEmbeddings(
    project_id=8, model_name="text-embedding-3-large"
)
```
## Calling the Embedding Model

Now you are all set. Now let's start using our embedding model with a single query followed by multiple queries (which is also called as a document)

```python
query = "Hello, this is a test query"
query_result = prem_embedding.get_text_embedding(query)
```

```python
print(f"Dimension of embeddings: {len(query_result)}")
```
Dimension of embeddings: 3072

```python
query_result[:5]
```
