### Core Components

All the components works indepedently and aims to achieve a single task.It is recommended to check out each of the components sequentially to get an overall idea and how to use them to the fullest.

## Why PremSQL? The Vision 

PremSQL focuses on creating local Text-to-SQL workflows. Many times, you don't want to share data with third-party systems, but still need to build generative AI solutions for productivity and innovation. PremSQL is designed to solve this by keeping your data local.

**Use Cases:**
- Database Q&A
- RAG with database integration
- SQL autocompletion
- AI-powered, self-hosted data analysis
- Autonomous agentic pipelines with database access

### How is it different from LangChain, Llama-Index, or DSPy? 

While these libraries excel in building general AI workflows, they often come with a steep learning curve for customization. PremSQL simplifies this, providing full control over your data and a smooth integration with existing LangChain, Llama-Index, or DSPy workflows.

## Getting Started

Install PremSQL with:
```bash
pip install -U premsql
```

Here's a quick starter code to chat with a sample database:

```python
from premsql.pipelines.simple import SimpleText2SQLAgent
from premsql.generators.huggingface import Text2SQLGeneratorHF
from premsql.evaluator import SQLiteExecutor

dsn_or_db_path = "./data/db/california_schools.sqlite"

agent = SimpleText2SQLAgent(
    dsn_or_db_path=dsn_or_db_path,
    generator=Text2SQLGeneratorHF(
        model_or_name_or_path="premai-io/prem-1B-SQL",
        experiment_name="simple_pipeline",
        device="cuda:0",
        type="test"
    ),
)

question = "please list the phone numbers of the direct charter-funded schools that are opened after 2000/1/1"

response = agent.query(question)
response["table"]
```

## Roadmap

PremSQL’s first release is just the beginning, and your feedback is crucial for enhancing our components. We're excited to announce upcoming features, including a synthesizer that will significantly reduce annotation time by generating synthetic datasets. Beyond this, we're focused on improving the developer experience with our existing components. 

Currently, database executions and SQL generations are not parallelizable, but future updates will bring significant performance improvements for generators and executors. While we currently offer robust support for SQLite databases, our LangChain Executors also connect with other database types, and you can easily create custom connectors. In our upcoming versions, we plan to introduce major connectors for additional databases to expand our compatibility.

Stay tuned and follow our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/premAI-io/premsql) for the latest updates and improvements!
