 <Card title = "How credits work:" icon="coins" iconType="duotone" color="#ca8b04">**Prem** credits provide a convenient way to pay for API usage and allow you to scale your consumption based on your needs. By managing your credits effectively, you can build and deploy your models created with **Prem** while controlling your costs.</Card>

## Credit calculation

Our calculations are based on per 1M token usage. This token usage is based on the model tier you are using. 
You can check out [all the available models and it's tiers here](/get-started/supported-models.mdx).

In summary here is how we do our calculations:

- `Low tier:` $ 0.54 per 1 million tokens for the low tier Prem models.
- `Medium Tier:` $ 9.25 per 1 million tokens for the medium tier Prem models.
- `High Tier:` $ 67.5 per 1 million tokens for the high tier Prem models.

The prices are subject to change and are provided here for reference purposes only.


<Note>
Update (August 1st 2024): We are updating our pricing terms. Please see the details below. Previously our
calculation was done on the basis of requests. With our new pricing strategy we calculate is based on token
usage. So for existing users, it might look like, we have lowered the credits but in reality, you will recieve
more tokens.
