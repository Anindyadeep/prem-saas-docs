description: The [chat completion](/api-reference/chat-completions/post-v1chatcompletions) endpoint provides a way to generate chat completions based on provided input messages. This endpoint supports streaming via Server-Sent Events (SSE), allowing for partial message deltas to be sent back to the client.

## Request
