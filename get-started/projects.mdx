Each project represents a single use case, designed to enhance your product by integrating generative AI.

For example, if you run an online store and use **Prem**, you could initiate a project titled “Customer Support” to address questions from your customers.
<Warning>Currently, we only support text-to-text projects (LLMs). However, we plan to introduce text-to-image support soon.</Warning>

You can also create new projects, modify them, or delete them if you need to. Think of each project as a test lab for trying out AI in ways that help your business.<img
