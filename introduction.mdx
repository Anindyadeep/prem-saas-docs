## Why Prem?

**Prem** is a platform thats packaged with the necessary tools to efforlessly integrate Generative AI into your applications.

## With Prem you can:

- **Simultaneously test and monitor LLM's in the [_Prem Lab_](/get-started/lab):** Compare the performance of multiple models and find the best fit for your use case.
- **Train models in the [_Prem Gym_](/get-started/gym):** Leverage Prem’s ability to autonomously fine-tune models. The Gym is your place to beef up your deployment models by continuously fine-tuning your data in order to improve performance.
- **Seamlessly create [_RAG-based assistants_](/get-started/repositories):** Prem is capable of interacting with your documents. Just upload the documents, and we’ll take care of the rest.
- **[_Launch_](/get-started/launchpad) and use the [_Prem Javascript and Python SDKs_](/get-started/sdk):** Integrate your custom AI into you applications with minimal effort.

</Step>

<Step title="Now its time to integrate Prem into your application.">
## Choose an SDK and install.

<CodeGroup>
```Python Python
pip install premai
```

```JavaScript JavaScript
npm install @premai/prem-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

## Run your first project.

<CodeGroup>
```Python Python
from premai import Prem

client = Prem(
api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
)

messages = [
{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
{"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
]
model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
project_id = PROJECT_ID

# Create completion

response = client.chat.completions.create(
project_id=project_id,
messages=messages,
model=model,
stream=False
)

print(response.choices)

# Create completion with stream

response = client.chat.completions.create(
project_id=project_id,
messages=messages,
model=model,
stream=True
)

for chunk in response:
if chunk.choices[0].delta["content"]:
print(chunk.choices[0].delta["content"], end="")

print(f"\nTrace ID: {response.trace_id}")

````

```JavaScript JavaScript
import Prem from '@premai/prem-sdk';

const client = new Prem({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"
})

const project_id = PROJECT_ID

const model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
const messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
]

// Create completion


console.log(responseSync)

// Create completion with stream
const responseAsync = await client.chat.completions.create({
  project_id,
  messages,
  model,
  stream: true
})

for await (const chunk of responseAsync) {
  if (chunk.choices[0].delta.content) {
    process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0].delta.content)
  }
}

console.log("\nTrace ID", responseAsync.trace_id)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

</Steps>



## Next steps

- Continue to test LLMs in the [Lab](/get-started/lab).
- Check out the [API reference](/api-reference/introduction).
- [Conect your documents](/get-started/repositories) to the LLM to enhance its knowledge.
- Finetune your LLM's in the [Gym](/get-started/gym).
