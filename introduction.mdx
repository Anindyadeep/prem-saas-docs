### Why Prem?

**Prem** makes it easy to integrate Generative AI into your applications. It's a platform that combines a simple SDK (in Python and JavaScript) with a straightforward user interface. Prem is an all-in-one suite for assessing LLM performance with built-in evaluation and monitoring tools, simple fine-tuning, RAG without the hassle and deployment.

## Quickstart

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Python">
  ✌️ This guide shows you how to create a Generative AI application with Prem's Python SDK in minutes.
   
   1. [Activate your Prem account](https://app.premai.io/accounts/signup/)
   2. **Sign in** and  generate an API key
   3. Create a new Project
   <Info>See that we've set you up with a starter project already. You have a choice to use the starter project or create a new project. <p>- _**For example** you start a new project called “Product Descriptions” to help write unique descriptions for your items. Or you might have a “Customer Support” project, where AI helps answer questions from your customers.
  You can also make new projects, change them, or delete them if you need to. Think of each project as a test lab for trying out AI in ways that help your business._</p></Info>
   4. Head over to the **_Lab_** and experiment with various LLMs simultaneously
   5. After you've experimented with differnt models in the lab, choose the most suitable one for your usecase. Then, go to the launchpad and launch the it directly from the user interface. 
   6. Now its time to integrate Prem into your application.

```Python
pip install premai
```

```Python
from premai import Prem

client = Prem(
    api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
)

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
]
model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
project_id = PROJECT_ID

# Create completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    project_id=project_id,
    messages=messages,
    model=model,
    stream=False
)

print(response.choices)

# Create completion with stream
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    project_id=project_id,
    messages=messages,
    model=model,
    stream=True
)

for chunk in response:
    if chunk.choices[0].delta["content"]:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta["content"], end="")

print(f"\nTrace ID: {response.trace_id}")
```

const messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
]

// Create completion

console.log(responseSync)

// Create completion with stream
const responseAsync = await client.chat.completions.create({
  project_id,
  messages,
  model,
  stream: true
})
for await (const chunk of responseAsync) {
  if (chunk.choices[0].delta.content) {
    process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0].delta.content)
  }
} console.log("\nTrace ID", responseAsync.trace_id)
```
